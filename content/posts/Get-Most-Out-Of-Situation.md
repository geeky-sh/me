I feel there are three ways to get the most out of our lives.

1. Maintain a **calm** demeanour - both internally and externally - in every situation
2. Always **think objectively**, logically, rationally and intelligently in all situations.
    - Keep a constant feedback loop of taking the previous actions into account while deriving current actions.
3. Use **imaginative abilities** to decipher situations, come up with future outcomes, understand complex concepts.


All three are at some point interdependent on each other. It is very important to always follow and apply these three fundamental concepts to navigate any situation in life.
